This is a collection of personal mini-projects, assignments, and experiments I did throughout my developer life. 
I won't consider them as something that deserves its own repo, but they're definitely worthy of being preserved in one place instead of being forgotten in private repos, dusty HDDs, or emails sent 10 years ago.

Also, while finding something and putting it here, now I can tell people that "I work in the Archive."

- [2014 Entangler](https://github.com/dbudyak/archive/tree/master/desktop/entangler) - my Master's project that deserved much better dedication back in the day
- [2016 The TVDB Client](https://github.com/dbudyak/archive/tree/master/android/TheTVDB) - home assignment for an Android dev position at a locally popular media streaming company
- [201x](https://github.com/dbudyak/archive/tree/master/android/letsfly) - likely another home assignment for another Android dev position
- [2016](https://github.com/dbudyak/archive/tree/master/android/flibsAndroid) - a thing to read books, made it for a friend
- [201x](https://github.com/dbudyak/archive/tree/master/android/medbox-android) - bootstrapped Android client for a prospective medical startup, which lasted for almost two months
- [2022](https://github.com/dbudyak/archive/tree/master/backend/wolt-task-openhours) - backend home assigment for Wolt.....
